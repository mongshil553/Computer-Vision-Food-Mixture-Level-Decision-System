<h2>Utilizing Hue Entropy</h2>
Key idea to solving this problem is Using Hue compoment of an image. Convert the RGB Image into HSI Image, Getting Hue, Saturation, Intensity information. Hue is mainly used to define what color the bit is. By calculating the Entropy of Hue, we get to know how diverse the colors are in an image.
